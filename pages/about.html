            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jose Segura and I made this webpage to show my future employers all the credible work I've done
            throughout my bootcamp, as well as my professional career. Although not much is on here as of right now, I do plan on adding more work and styling as I progress through the bootcamp.
