* This assignment was an excersise to challenge our skills when it comes to creating a webpage out of scratch, however the difficulties, I eas able to learn new things in order to help me finish this assignment. I intend in using this website to store my previous assignments as well as any projects we work on in the future. At the moment I don't have much to work with but with more knowledge and accomplishments I can fill and stylize this webpage to my heart's content.
